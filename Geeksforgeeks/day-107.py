#  More than n/k Occurrences

# Given an array arr and an element k. The task is to find the count of elements in the array that appear more than n/k times and n is length of arr.

# Examples :
# Input: arr = [3, 1, 2, 2, 1, 2, 3, 3], k = 4
# Output: 2
# Explanation: In the given array, 3 and 2 are the only elements that appears more than n/k times.
# Input: arr = [2, 3, 3, 2], k = 3
# Output: 2
# Explanation: In the given array, 3 and 2 are the only elements that appears more than n/k times. So the count of elements are 2.
# Input: arr = [1, 4, 7, 7], k = 2
# Output: 0
# Explanation: In the given array, no element appears more than n/k times.

   
# Function to find all elements in array that appear more than n/k times.
def countOccurence(arr, k):
    dct = {}
    n = len(arr)
    # print(n)
    count_val = n/k
    # print("count ",count_val)

    for val in arr:
        if val not in dct:
            dct[val] = 1 
        else:
            dct[val] += 1 
    # print(dct)    
    count =  0 
    for key,val  in dct.items():
        # print(key,val) 
        if val > count_val:
            count += 1 
    return count          

print(countOccurence([3, 1, 2, 2, 1, 2, 3, 3], k = 4))
