# Count the elements
# Given two arrays a and b both of size n. Given q queries in an array query each having a positive integer x denoting an index of the array a. For each query, your task is to find all the elements less than or equal to a[x] in the array b.

# Example 1:
# Input:
# n = 3
# a[] = {4,1,2}
# b[] = {1,7,3}
# q = 2
# query[] = {0,1}
# Output : 
# 2
# 1
# Explanation: 
# For 1st query, the given index is 0, a[0] = 4. There are 2 elements(1 and 3) which are less than or equal to 4.
# For 2nd query, the given index is 1, a[1] = 1. There exists only 1 element(1) which is less than or equal to 1.
# Example 2:

# Input:
# n = 4
# a[] = {1,1,5,5}
# b[] = {0,1,2,3}
# q = 4
# query[] = {0,1,2,3}
# Output : 
# 2
# 2
# 4
# 4
# Explanation: 
# For 1st query and 2nd query, the given index is 0 and 1 respectively, a[0] = a[1] = 1. There are 2 elements(0 and 1) which are less than or equal to 1. 
# For 3rd query and 4th query, the given index is 2 and 3 respectively, a[2] = a[3] = 5. All the 4 elements are less than or equal to 5.
