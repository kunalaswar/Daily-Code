 #  Find the closest number

# Given a sorted array arr[] of positive integers. The task is to find the closest value in the array to the given number k. The array may contain duplicate values.
# Note: If the difference with k is the same for two values in the array return the greater value.

# Examples :
# Input:  arr[] = [1, 3, 6, 7], k = 4
# Output: 3
# Explanation: We have array arr={1, 3, 6, 7} and target is 4. If we look at the absolute difference of target with every element of the array we will get { |1-4|, |3-4|, |6-4|, |7-4| }  = {3, 1, 2, 3}. So, the closest number is 3.
# Input: arr[] = [1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 8, 9], k = 4
# Output: 5
# Explanation: The absolute difference of 4 is 1 from both 3 and 5. According to the question, we have to return greater value, which is 5.
# Input: arr[] = [6, 8, 8, 8, 9, 11, 13, 13, 15, 18, 19], k = 10
# Output: 11

#* abs menas -> negative → positive  &  positive → stays same

def findclosest(arr,k):
    closest = arr[0]
    for num in arr :
        # print(num)
        if abs(num-k) < abs(closest - k):
            closest  = num 
        elif abs(num-k) == abs(closest-k):
            if num > closest:
                closest = num 
    return closest     


print(findclosest([1, 3, 6, 7], k = 4))
print(findclosest([1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 8, 9], k = 4))
print(findclosest([6, 8, 8, 8, 9, 11, 13, 13, 15, 18, 19], k = 10))
