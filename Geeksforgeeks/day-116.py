# Product of an Array
# Given an array, arr[] of positive integers. Your task is to return the product of array elements under the given modulo, mod with the value of 1000000007.

# Note: The modulo operation finds the remainder after the division of one number by another. For example, k(mod(m))=k%m= remainder obtained when k is divided by m

# Examples:
# Input: arr[] = [1, 2, 3, 4]
# Output: 24
# Explanation: The product of the elements in the array is 1×2×3×4=24. Since 24 is less than 1000000007, the output is simply 24.
# Input: arr[] = [100000, 100000, 100000]
# Output: 993000007
# Explanation:  The product of the array elements is 100000 × 100000 × 100000 = 1000000000000000. Taking modulo 1000000007, the result is 1000000000000000 % 1000000007 = 993000007

class Solution:

    def product(self, arr):

        mul = 1
        for i in arr:
            mul = mul * i
        return mul % 1000000007  

s = Solution()        
print(s.product([1, 2, 3, 4]))
print(s.product([100000, 100000, 100000]))
